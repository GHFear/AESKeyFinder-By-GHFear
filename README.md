# AESKeyFinder-By-GHFear
Tool for finding 256-bit AES keys in Unreal Engine 4 and 5 executables.<br>
This tool uses QuickBMS and QuickBMS scripting to dump AES keys from UE4 and UE5 .exe files.<br>

Made this years ago when I was really into QuickBMS scripting.<br>
Sadly Zenhax went down and I lost ALL other QuickBMS scripts.
